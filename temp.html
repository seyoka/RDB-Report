<h2 id="introduction">1 Introduction</h2>
<p>The concept of <strong>databases</strong> revolutionised the way data
is stored, organised, and retrieved in computing systems. In
<strong>1970</strong>, British computer scientist <strong>Edgar F.
Codd</strong>, working at IBM, introduced the <strong>relational
model</strong>—a new, more logical way to structure data using tables
(known as <strong>relations</strong>) rather than the complex
hierarchical or network models that preceded it.</p>
<p>Codd’s groundbreaking paper, <em>“A Relational Model of Data for
Large Shared Data Banks”</em>, laid the theoretical foundation for what
would become modern relational database systems. His work introduced key
principles such as <strong>data independence</strong>, <strong>logical
consistency</strong>, and the application of <strong>set theory</strong>
and <strong>predicate calculus</strong> to database management.</p>
<p>Today, relational databases underpin many core systems across
industries, from banking and healthcare to e-commerce and national
infrastructure. This report explores a range of domains and use cases,
evaluating the effectiveness of entity relational modelling across
services including identity verification, healthcare monitoring, and
trading systems.</p>
<p>The following sections will introduce domain-specific analyses,
initial and revised relational models, and reflections on the modelling
process to illustrate the power and limitations of relational database
design in practice.</p>
<h2 id="domain-analysis">2 Domain Analysis</h2>
<h3 id="national-identity-service">2.1 National Identity Service</h3>
<p>We defined the purpose of this system as: “<em>A database model that
allows for citizens of a country to be indentified and store additional
information on the citizen</em>”.</p>
<p>Based on that purpose, we continued the domain analysis for the
National Indentity Service, identified a range of key stakeholders: -
Citizens - Residents - Employers - Public servants: - Gardaí - An Post -
Immigration - HSE personnel</p>
<p>We set up the requirements of the system to be: - Needs to track data
on: - Unique personal identifiers (e.g UUID + PPSN for addtional
security) - Personal details (name, date of birth, nationality) -
Residency and citizenship status - Employment status - Must support: -
Secure document storage and retrieval - Scoped, role based access
control - Encrypiton of data at rest and transit - Integeration with
government systems (e.g., Immigration) - Controlled record deletion</p>
<p>from this indentification we were able to create an initial domain

<h4
id="review-and-reflection-national-identity-service-comparative-analysis">4.1
Review and Reflection – National Identity Service (Comparative
Analysis)</h4>
<p>In comparing our implementation of the National Identity Service with
Mahidi’s alternative version, several design differences and conceptual
trade-offs become apparent. Both designs reflect core relational
principles outlined by Connolly and Begg (2015), yet diverge in how they
approach <strong>data richness</strong>, <strong>normalisation</strong>,
and <strong>real-world extensibility</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Shared Foundations</strong></p>
<p>Both models treat the <code>Citizen</code> as a central entity, with
direct attributes such as name, date of birth, gender, and place of
birth. Each system also captures the relationship between a citizen and
their physical address using a <strong>many-to-many structure</strong>
via a linking table (<code>AddressToPerson</code> in our model,
<code>Citizen_Address</code> in Mahidi’s).</p>
<p>Similarly, both designs adhere to <strong>normalisation
principles</strong>. Neither duplicates address or document data inside
the citizen entity; instead, each normalises this information into its
own entity or relationship. These patterns align with relational
modelling best practices (Connolly and Begg, 2015), specifically the
move towards third normal form (3NF) and the use of foreign keys to
ensure referential integrity.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Key Differences in Design</strong></p>
<p>Where the models differ most is in scope, granularity, and their
interpretation of the problem space:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Card vs. Document Design</strong><br />
Mahidi’s model introduces a dedicated <code>ID_Card</code> table with
metadata like issue date, expiry date, status, and a relationship to the
<code>Government</code>. This is a focused, single-purpose approach
centered on formal identity issuance. In contrast, our system
generalises this into a <code>Document</code> table with support for
various types (e.g., scanned passports, residency proof), stored as
BLOBs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our approach offers greater flexibility for integrating document
management at scale, whereas Mahidi’s is tightly coupled to the
production of physical identity cards.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Government Interaction</strong><br />
Mahidi’s model explicitly models the <code>Government</code> as an
entity responsible for issuing ID cards. While our model omits this as a
formal table, the same functionality could be abstracted through
application-level constraints or scoped access control.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Application Process</strong><br />
Mahidi’s schema features an <code>Application</code> table, capturing
the process of a citizen applying for an ID. This allows traceability of
issuance and eligibility. Our system does not explicitly model
applications — instead assuming persistence is controlled by
administrator input.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While this is a limitation in our design, it could be incorporated in
future iterations as a <code>Request</code> or <code>Application</code>
entity.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Financial and Employment Information</strong><br />
A notable strength of our model is its inclusion of
<code>Occupation</code> and <code>Finances</code>, allowing the state to
capture economic status, wage, benefits, and employer data. Mahidi’s
model excludes this dimension entirely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This additional granularity supports public policy analysis and makes
our model suitable for integration with tax, welfare, or immigration
systems.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Types and Field Complexity</strong><br />
Mahidi uses enums for <code>gender</code>, <code>type</code>, and
<code>status</code>, enforcing domain constraints directly at the schema
level. We use <code>boolean</code> and <code>varchar</code> types,
deferring validation to application logic. Both are valid approaches,
though the enum strategy provides better <strong>in-database
enforcement</strong> of domain rules.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reflection</strong></p>
<p>Mahidi’s design is clean and focused, and models the lifecycle of ID
card issuance well. It is likely more appropriate for a narrowly scoped
system intended solely for ID management.</p>
<p>By contrast, our system was designed with <strong>national-scale
extensibility</strong> in mind — including employment tracking, income,
documents beyond ID cards, and support for multiple administrative
services. It assumes a broader context, one that integrates with
welfare, housing, immigration, and taxation systems.</p>
<p>As Connolly and Begg (2015) note, “the quality of a database design
is not measured only by adherence to normal forms, but also by its
ability to satisfy future requirements” (p. 367). Our schema anticipates
that evolution.</p>
<h4
id="review-and-reflection-vehicle-identity-service-comparative-analysis">4.2
Review and Reflection – Vehicle Identity Service (Comparative
Analysis)</h4>
<p>Sarah’s relational model for the Vehicle Identity Service takes a
structured, form-based approach to vehicle records, ownership, and
regulation. It demonstrates clear effort toward domain coverage and
entity relationship thinking. While our model shares many foundational
features, the two diverge in how comprehensively they handle regulation
data, the depth of real-time interaction tracking, and treatment of
auxiliary data like sensors.</p>
<p><strong>Shared Design Strengths</strong></p>
<p>At a high level, both models capture the essential relationships
needed to manage a national vehicle registry. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A central <code>Vehicle</code> entity with associated metadata
(e.g., make, model, registration).</li>
<li>A link between <code>Vehicle</code> and <code>Owner</code> to
represent legal possession.</li>
<li>A structure for capturing <strong>incidents</strong> and
<strong>regulatory compliance</strong> (e.g., NCT data in Sarah’s design
vs. <code>Tax</code> and <code>Fines</code> in ours).</li>
<li>A relational model grounded in <strong>normalised form</strong>,
with domain-driven attribute naming and use of surrogate keys
(<code>VehicleID</code>, <code>OwnerID</code>, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>Both models reflect practices recommended by Connolly and Begg
(2015), including the use of separate tables for repeating groups (e.g.,
incident logs, insurance) and capturing many-to-many relationships
through linking entities or associative attributes.</p>
<p><strong>Differences in Scope and Priorities</strong></p>
<p>While both models are structurally sound, our implementations differ
notably in their focus areas and complexity:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Sensor and Telematics Integration</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sarah’s design includes a <code>Sensor</code> entity with a direct
relationship to <code>Vehicle</code>, suggesting the system is intended
to capture <strong>real-time telemetry</strong> (e.g., sensor type,
location, vehicle performance).</li>
<li>Our model, while detailed, does not include real-time integration or
telematics — it is more focused on ownership, licensing, and
administrative tasks.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Sarah’s approach reflects a <strong>future-forward design</strong>
for smart vehicle tracking and might align well with autonomous vehicle
logging or fleet monitoring systems.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><strong>Incident Reporting Granularity</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sarah uses a dedicated <code>Incidents</code> table with attributes
like date, type, and time recorded. This enables detailed audit trails
and structured traffic offence tracking.</li>
<li>Our model logs traffic offences and penalties through the
<code>Fines</code> table, which is simpler and more monetary-focused,
without capturing contextual metadata.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>NCT Modelling</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sarah explicitly models the <code>NCT</code> test entity, including
issue/expiry dates, test result status, and even an NCT number.</li>
<li>We track roadworthiness using boolean <code>isTaxed</code> and
license data but abstract the testing process.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Sarah’s model shows a <strong>stronger commitment to regulatory
data</strong> — ideal for inspection reporting and scheduling
integrations.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><strong>Ownership Details</strong>
<ul>
<li>Our <code>Person</code> entity connects indirectly to the
<code>Vehicle</code> entity via a <code>driverNumber</code>, whereas
Sarah’s <code>Owner</code> table includes owner-specific information
such as license number and address inline.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Sarah’s model is <strong>more direct but less extensible</strong>,
whereas ours separates citizen records from vehicle metadata, allowing
for future links to broader national identity records.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Reflection</strong></p>
<p>Overall, Sarah’s implementation aligns closely with the type of
relational model Connolly and Begg (2015) describe for systems requiring
robust regulatory and sensor-driven infrastructure. It is rigorous in
its domain modelling, and well-suited to environments where the vehicle
is a <strong>source of live data</strong> and not just a static
record.</p>
<p>In contrast, our model is oriented toward <strong>administrative
traceability</strong> — tracking taxes, fines, insurance, and ownership
over time. While our model is extensible and aligned with government
backend systems, it lacks the real-time sensibility and incident audit
depth that Sarah’s brings.</p>

Review and Reflection – Ski Track Service (Comparative Analysis)</h4>
<p>Aoibheann’s design for the Ski Track Service takes a modular and
relational approach to tracking skier activity, slope conditions, and
run metadata. Both our implementation and hers aim to represent skier
performance and environmental context, yet each interprets and
structures the domain differently based on the emphasis placed on
usability, extensibility, and performance tracking.</p>
<p><strong>Shared Modelling Principles</strong></p>
<p>At a structural level, our implementation and Aoibheann’s share
several best-practice features consistent with the relational data
modelling advice outlined in Connolly and Begg (2015):</p>
<ul>
<li>A central entity (<code>Run</code>) that represents each skiing
attempt, linked to performance-related attributes such as
<code>speed</code>, <code>distance</code>, and
<code>duration</code>.</li>
<li>A <code>Skier</code> entity that captures user credentials and
contextual data like <code>location</code> or
<code>payment status</code>.</li>
<li>Support for associating multiple runs with a session, allowing
grouped tracking of daily activity.</li>
<li>Use of foreign keys to relate <code>Run</code>,
<code>Session</code>, <code>Skier</code>, and environmental context
tables.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both models aim for at least <strong>Third Normal Form (3NF)</strong>
by separating repeating groups (e.g., multiple runs per session) and
relying on surrogate keys to manage entity relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Key Differences in Modelling Choices</strong></p>
<p>Despite these similarities, the two schemas diverge meaningfully in
terms of their <strong>conceptual model</strong> and intended
<strong>query behaviour</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Environmental Modelling: Weather vs. Conditions</strong>
<ul>
<li>Aoibheann’s model includes a <code>WeatherConditions</code> table,
with separate attributes like <code>warning</code>,
<code>temperature</code>, and <code>humidity</code>, each linked to a
specific <code>Session</code>.</li>
<li>Our implementation flattens weather-related data into the
<code>Run</code> or <code>Session</code> entities, favouring
simplicity.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Aoibheann’s approach improves <strong>queryability</strong> for
weather-specific filtering (e.g., “runs during warnings”), whereas our
approach reduces table joins but sacrifices granularity.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><strong>Session Structuring</strong>
<ul>
<li>Aoibheann introduces a fully separate <code>Session</code> table
with attributes for start/end time, number of runs, and a
<code>weatherID</code> reference.</li>
<li>We also used a <code>Session</code> abstraction but allowed it to be
more implicit, assuming it’s created automatically per user day.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Her approach better supports future features like badges for streaks
or scheduling, following Connolly and Begg’s recommendation to
“anticipate extension” (2015, p. 126).</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><strong>Slope Entity Design</strong>
<ul>
<li>Aoibheann’s <code>Slope</code> table includes
<code>difficulty</code>, <code>height</code>, and <code>colour</code>
(enum), which makes it easier to filter based on difficulty level or
visual classification.</li>
<li>Our slope modelling is more minimal, focusing only on slope ID and
average grade.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Aoibheann’s design anticipates use cases such as <strong>route
planning</strong>, while ours is optimised for performance
analytics.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><strong>Authentication and Payment</strong>
<ul>
<li>Her <code>Skier</code> table includes user credentials
(<code>username</code>, <code>password</code>) and subscription status,
likely anticipating a <strong>login and payment portal</strong>.</li>
<li>Our system models the skier more abstractly, assuming user data is
managed by an external system.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Aoibheann’s schema is closer to a production SaaS product, whereas
ours is more analytical in nature.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Reflection</strong></p>
<p>Aoibheann’s schema exhibits strong attention to <strong>real-world
modularity</strong>. It introduces useful abstractions like
<code>WeatherConditions</code>, granular slope metadata, and
session-level tracking. Her use of separate lookup tables and enums
demonstrates an understanding of <strong>data integrity</strong> and
<strong>domain constraint enforcement</strong>, both hallmarks of
well-structured relational design.</p>
<p>Our implementation, while more performance-focused, trades off
granularity for simplicity. It’s optimised for use cases such as
real-time tracking or rapid analytics, but lacks explicit handling of
subscriptions, weather warnings, or route metadata.</p>
<p>Connolly and Begg (2015) emphasise that a model should be evaluated
not solely on its current structure, but on its ability to
<strong>support diverse query workloads</strong> (p. 496). In this
regard, Aoibheann’s design outperforms ours in user session management
and slope exploration, whereas ours is more agile in processing and
aggregating user run data.</p>
<h4
id="review-and-reflection-diabetes-monitoring-service-comparative-analysis">4.4
Review and Reflection – Diabetes Monitoring Service (Comparative
Analysis)</h4>
<p>Ciarán’s model of the Diabetes Monitoring Service emphasizes patient
health tracking and caregiver support within a medical context. While
our implementation is also built around data-informed diabetic care, our
focus leans more toward real-time analysis and educational guidance.
Both approaches model the diabetic experience effectively but differ in
granularity, extensibility, and target user.</p>
<p><strong>Shared Concepts and Modelling Strategies</strong></p>
<p>Our schema and Ciarán’s share several foundational similarities:</p>
<ul>
<li>A central <code>Patient</code> entity with associated personal and
medical data.</li>
<li>A <code>Test</code> entity storing key medical metrics (e.g.,
glucose levels, insulin dosage).</li>
<li>A table to capture <strong>medical history</strong>, which promotes
longitudinal tracking of patient health.</li>
<li>Many-to-many relationships between patients and supporting
stakeholders (e.g., <code>Caregiver</code>, <code>Doctor</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>These designs align with Connolly and Begg’s (2015) recommendation to
separate core entities and avoid attribute duplication by using
<strong>foreign keys and associative relationships</strong>
(p. 150).</p>
<p><strong>Major Differences in Structure and Priorities</strong></p>
<p>Despite their shared domain, each model reflects different
assumptions about the system’s purpose and intended users:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Caregiver Relationships</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ciarán includes a <code>Caregiver</code> entity directly linked to
<code>Patient</code>, with flags for <code>Professional</code> or
<code>Family</code>. This is useful for clinical or home support
scenarios.</li>
<li>Our implementation groups caregivers under a general stakeholder
role and focuses more on the <strong>data</strong> visible to each party
(e.g., glucose readings, HbA1c).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Ciarán’s model promotes <strong>role-aware data sharing</strong>,
whereas ours targets <strong>data-rich dashboards</strong> for
clinicians and educators.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><strong>Medical History Design</strong>
<ul>
<li>His <code>Medical History</code> entity explicitly lists attributes
like <code>illness</code>, <code>treatment</code>, and
<code>last checkup</code> with a timestamp.</li>
<li>We track stats like TIR (Time in Range), TAR (Time Above Range), and
excursions over time, focusing on trend analytics.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Ciarán’s model offers <strong>qualitative insights</strong>, while
ours is better suited for <strong>quantitative dashboards</strong> and
machine learning readiness.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><strong>Test and Equipment Tracking</strong>
<ul>
<li>The <code>Test</code> entity in his model includes insulin/blood
levels and references equipment used (e.g., CGMs).</li>
<li>Ours isolates test results and handles external integrations
implicitly, assuming data arrives via an API or import.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>His design is more complete for <strong>clinical audits</strong>,
while ours prioritises data portability and integration with external
health platforms.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><strong>Diabetes Classification</strong>
<ul>
<li>Both models have a <code>Diabetes</code> entity. Ciarán adds a
<code>severity</code> rating to his, which enables prioritisation or
alerts.</li>
<li>We expand this with <code>type</code>, <code>description</code>,
<code>symptoms</code>, and <code>treatments</code>, supporting patient
education and clinical decision-making.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Reflection</strong></p>
<p>Ciarán’s schema is focused on the <strong>clinical and care-giving
side</strong> of diabetes monitoring. It handles family support, doctor
oversight, medical equipment, and past history with detail and empathy —
ideal for use in hospitals or care homes.</p>
<p>In contrast, our model is better suited to <strong>data-driven health
monitoring</strong> — integrating CGM devices, exporting time-in-range
data, and tracking glycaemic variability. This makes it ideal for
researchers, app developers, and diabetes educators.</p>
<h4
id="review-and-reflection-anticoagulation-monitoring-service-comparative-analysis">4.5
Review and Reflection – Anticoagulation Monitoring Service (Comparative
Analysis)</h4>
<p>James’s design for the Anticoagulation Monitoring Service closely
mirrors our own system in its core objective: tracking patient
coagulation metrics through connected medical devices and healthcare
professionals. However, there are key differences in structure,
extensibility, and stakeholder representation that reflect differing
assumptions and design goals.</p>
<p><strong>Shared Structure and Domain Alignment</strong></p>
<p>Both implementations are based on well-established relational
principles and share key structural components:</p>
<ul>
<li>A central <code>Patient</code> entity holding demographic
information and foreign keys to medical context.</li>
<li>A <code>Device</code> entity linked to a patient, recording usage
and operational status (e.g., battery).</li>
<li>A <code>Reading</code> table capturing real-time or periodic metrics
such as INR, PT, and aPTT values with timestamps.</li>
<li>A <code>Condition</code> entity holding safety thresholds for
patients with clotting disorders.</li>
</ul>
<p>These choices follow Connolly and Begg’s (2015) principles of
normalisation and data independence, ensuring data integrity and
avoiding redundancy (p. 330).</p>
<p><strong>Key Differences in Design Decisions</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Device Attribution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>James’s model defines the <code>Device</code> entity with a direct
reference to the patient and includes a <code>battery</code>
attribute.</li>
<li>Our model introduces more detailed device metadata, enabling
tracking of different device types, calibration dates, and software
versions.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>James’s model is simpler and effective for basic tracking,
whereas ours supports long-term monitoring and hardware
diversity.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Address Representation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>James includes a standalone <code>Address</code> entity with
postcode and town, linked via foreign keys to both <code>Doctor</code>
and <code>Patient</code>.</li>
<li>Our system assumes that address information is managed externally
(e.g., user directory or identity service) and does not model it
directly.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>James’s inclusion of geographic data strengthens auditability and
regulatory compliance but introduces more maintenance
overhead.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Condition Monitoring</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>James’s <code>Condition</code> entity includes therapeutic ranges
such as safe INR limits, offering clear medical thresholds.</li>
<li>We opt to store readings and let business logic or external systems
evaluate whether values fall within safe zones.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>His approach is ideal for systems with built-in alerting, while
ours is more flexible but requires external validation
logic.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Caregiver and Stakeholder Roles</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>James’s model omits caregivers or support roles beyond doctors.</li>
<li>Our model includes carer/doctor roles explicitly and accounts for
role-based access to sensitive data.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Our schema is better suited for systems with multiple actors,
such as family members or care teams.</em></p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Reflection</strong></p>
<p>James’s implementation is highly pragmatic, particularly for
deployment in clinical settings where auditability, traceability, and
clarity are essential. The inclusion of a rich <code>Address</code>
schema, well-scoped <code>Condition</code> thresholds, and simple device
assignment makes his design well-suited for hospital-based or regulated
medical environments.</p>
<p>In contrast, our implementation is built with flexibility in mind. It
reduces data coupling, integrates external systems, and anticipates
growth toward diverse use cases like app-based patient tracking, remote
monitoring, or integrations with third-party analytics.</p>

Review and Reflection – Civil Aerospace Health Monitoring System
(Comparative Analysis)</h4>
<p>Junior’s implementation for the aerospace engine health monitoring
system reflects a comprehensive and engineering-focused design,
capturing a broad range of environmental, mechanical, and
performance-related metrics. While both systems aim to monitor and
optimise turbine performance for safety and maintenance planning, our
schema and Junior’s diverge in their modelling of telemetry, component
granularity, and sensor infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Shared Design Patterns and Schema Intent</strong></p>
<p>At the core, both models implement the following shared concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <code>Engine</code> entity with references to aircraft and key
physical attributes (e.g., size, thrust).</li>
<li>Detailed metrics stored in dedicated performance tables
(<code>EngineStats</code> in Junior’s, <code>RealtimeFlightData</code>
in ours), including temperature, fuel rate, and environmental
factors.</li>
<li>A separation of <code>Component</code> entities for modular tracking
and diagnostics.</li>
<li>Relationships that link sensors or health indicators to specific
engine instances.</li>
</ul>
<p>These similarities show adherence to Connolly and Begg’s (2015)
principle of <strong>semantic data modelling</strong>, where each
real-world concept maps cleanly to an entity or relationship
(p. 84).</p>
<p><strong>Differences in Modelling Strategy</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Component and Subsystem Detail</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Junior splits <code>EngineComponents</code> into specific part types
(e.g., <code>Exhaust</code>, <code>Compressor</code>) and uses separate
identifiers and composite keys.</li>
<li>Our model consolidates these into a more generic
<code>Component</code> entity with flexible metadata for
<code>make</code>, <code>model</code>, and
<code>healthStatus</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Junior’s model offers greater diagnostic visibility but adds
schema complexity and coupling.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sensor Abstraction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Junior explicitly introduces a <code>Sensor</code> entity tied to
components, including calibration data and timestamps.</li>
<li>Our implementation records sensor output (e.g., temperature, EPR)
directly within the <code>RealtimeFlightData</code>, assuming internal
integration.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>His schema allows for modular sensor upgrades and multiple sensor
types, supporting modern avionics.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Environmental Monitoring</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Junior dedicates a <code>Weather</code> entity to capture altitude,
humidity, temperature, and air pressure.</li>
<li>We embed environmental values within the main stats table,
prioritising flat storage for analysis ease.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Junior’s approach supports reusability of weather records and
broader correlation, whereas ours simplifies querying at the cost of
separation of concerns.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Health Metrics and Safety Parameters</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Junior uses a <code>HealthMonitoringMetrics</code> table with
references to <code>Engine</code> and <code>CPUs</code>, whereas ours
calculates health indexes directly and stores it within engine
performance logs.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>His method offers a more <strong>auditable and traceable
trail</strong>, while ours is designed for <strong>real-time
inference</strong>.</em></p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Reflection</strong></p>
<p>Junior’s model reflects a <strong>systems engineering
mindset</strong>, designed for aircraft manufacturers, maintenance
teams, and telemetry analysts who need to monitor the health of specific
parts, sensors, and conditions. It is comprehensive, component-rich, and
structured for compliance with aerospace data reporting standards.</p>
<p>Our schema leans more toward an <strong>analytics-first
architecture</strong>, ideal for use in modern dashboards and predictive
maintenance tools. It’s less verbose but optimised for ETL pipelines,
streaming ingestion, and integration with AI/ML systems.</p>
<p>As Connolly and Begg (2015) assert, the design of a database must
“reflect not only the structure of the enterprise’s data but also the
operations that will be performed on it” (p. 138). Junior’s is better
suited to <strong>engineering diagnostics</strong>, while ours supports
<strong>data-driven operational decision-making</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="revised-model-national-identity-service">5.1 Revised Model –
National Identity Service</h2>
<p>Following an analysis of peer solutions (including Mahdi’s modular
design and governmental application layering), we have refined our ER
model to offer greater scalability, normalization, and clarity in data
relationships. This revised schema provides a robust foundation for
digital governance services such as ID verification, document storage,
and cross-departmental integration.</p>
<h3 id="notation-used">Notation Used</h3>
<p>The notation used in this model draws from Chen’s original
<strong>Entity-Relationship (ER) model</strong> notation (Chen, 1976),
which emphasizes the importance of clearly representing entities,
attributes, and relationships. In our implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Entities</strong> are represented as tables (e.g.,
<code>Citizen</code>, <code>Address</code>, <code>Document</code>), each
with a unique primary key.</li>
<li><strong>Relationships</strong> are expressed using <strong>foreign
keys</strong>, which provide referential links between entities (e.g.,
<code>citizen.address_id → address.id</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Attributes</strong> follow Chen’s principle of
atomicity—each field holds a single unit of information.</li>
<li><strong>Enum types</strong> are used to enforce controlled
vocabularies (e.g., gender, residency_status), which is in line with
Chen’s emphasis on domain constraints.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the original Chen notation uses diagrammatic boxes and
diamonds, our implementation uses a <strong>relational-style tabular
format</strong> (via <code>dbdiagram.io</code>) which is more suitable
for schema deployment and directly maps to SQL-based systems. This
decision was made to enhance developer clarity and reduce the gap
between logical and physical schema design.</p>

Revised ER Model: Civil Aerospace Gas Turbine Equipment Health
Monitoring System</h2>
<p>This revised model was developed after reviewing peer submissions,
particularly Junior’s detailed approach. The goal was to strike a
balance between <strong>diagnostic traceability</strong>,
<strong>performance telemetry</strong>, and
<strong>maintainability</strong>. We removed redundancy, clarified
relationships, and restructured environmental data collection while
keeping the model extensible.</p>
<h3 id="design-justification-and-rationale-1">Design Justification and
Rationale</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aircraft</strong>
<ul>
<li>Central entity, linked to engine and component instances.</li>
<li>Includes basic descriptive metadata and a <code>personnelId</code>
for maintenance accountability.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Engine</strong>
<ul>
<li>Associated directly with aircraft.</li>
<li>Stores fields such as <code>lastCheck</code> and
<code>serialNumber</code>, necessary for historical diagnostics and
manufacturer traceability.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Component</strong>
<ul>
<li>Represents subsystems (e.g., fans, compressors, filters).</li>
<li>Includes health metrics and relationships to historical maintenance
records.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Personnel</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tracks engineers, technicians, and pilots.</li>
<li>Linked to both <code>Aircraft</code> and
<code>ComponentHistory</code> for auditability.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>ComponentHistory</strong>
<ul>
<li>Logs interventions, status changes, and associated personnel.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>RealtimeFlightData</strong>
<ul>
<li>Captures in-flight performance data like <code>engineTemp</code>,
<code>TIT</code>, and <code>SFC</code>.</li>
<li>Tied to a specific <code>engineId</code> and
<code>aircraftId</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Test</strong>
<ul>
<li>Stores standardised component tests, with pass/fail outcomes and
timestamps.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>This revised schema emphaises <strong>clarity</strong>,
<strong>modularity</strong>, and <strong>support for predictive
maintenance systems</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="revised-er-model-card-trading-system">5.7 Revised ER Model: Card
Trading System</h2>
<p>The revised ER model for the Card Trading System was designed based
on insights gathered from reviewing other submissions (e.g. Junior’s,
Sarah’s) and aims to improve system modularity, transaction
traceability, and user-driven marketplace logic. The schema supports
card listings, bidding, wishlists, and the marketplace infrastructure
while remaining normalized and extensible.</p>
<h3 id="design-justification-and-rationale-2">Design Justification and
Rationale</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>User</strong>
<ul>
<li>Stores account information including personal identifiers and is
linked to card ownership, bidding, and wishlisting functionality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Card</strong>
<ul>
<li>Represents the base metadata of a card, tied to a set and
brand.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>CardInstance</strong>
<ul>
<li>Represents an individual, user-owned copy of a card. Includes
condition, description, grade, and ownership data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Brand and Set</strong>
<ul>
<li>Logical grouping structures for card series and manufacturers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Grade</strong>
<ul>
<li>Supports third-party grading certification.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Wishlist</strong>
<ul>
<li>Allows users to track cards they want, supporting future
recommendation features.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Auction &amp; Bid</strong>
<ul>
<li>Facilitates live card bidding systems. Bid table tracks all user
bids across auctions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>TradeOffer</strong>
<ul>
<li>Enables direct P2P trades between users involving specific card
instances.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>This design balances collector-specific features (like grading and
condition) with marketplace logic, supporting robust filtering, pricing,
and personalization.</p>
